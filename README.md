<h2> Premier League Forward Form</h2>
<h4> Project Description </h4>
<p> 
In this project, I decided to explore an underlooked part of public football data and take a look at how top premier league forwards' forms change throughout the season.
My metrics is xG and I used a 10 game rolling average of xG per 90 minutes as my defining metric and compared top 10 goalscorers in the PL throughout the 2021-22 season.

Despite being a basic metrics some valuable information can be seen in this graph. For example, Son and Kane's form has in fact imporved drastically under Conte while Diego Jota's form has decline probably since being replaced by Luis Diaz in the starting lineup.
