# Premier-League-Forward-Form
<h2> Premier League Forward Form</h2>
<h4> Project Description </h4>
<p> 
In this project, I decided to explore an underlooked part of public football data and take a look at how top premier league forwards' forms change throughout the season.
My metrics is xG and I used a 10 game rolling average of xG per 90 minutes as my defining metric and compared top 10 goalscorers in the PL throughout the 2021-22 season.
